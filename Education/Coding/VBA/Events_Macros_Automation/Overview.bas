' VBA Events_Macros_Automation overview
' -----------------------------------------
'
' Purpose:
' - Automate Excel tasks triggered by user actions or system events.
' - Write macros for repeated tasks or event-driven automation.
'
' Key concepts:
' 1. Workbook events (e.g., Workbook_Open, BeforeClose)
' 2. Worksheet events (e.g., Worksheet_Change, SelectionChange)
' 3. Writing macros (Sub procedures)
' 4. Enabling/disabling events via Application.EnableEvents
'
' Best practices:
' - Use events to create responsive, dynamic workbooks.
' - Be cautious to avoid infinite event loops.
' - Turn off events during code that modifies sheets to prevent unwanted triggers.
