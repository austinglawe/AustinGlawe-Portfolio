What it means:
Use a uniform style for naming variables, functions, classes, constants, etc.

Naming conventions differ by language but should be consistent within a project or team.

Why it matters:
Makes code more readable and predictable.

Reduces confusion and mistakes.

Helps tools and linters identify issues.

Common styles:
Style	Usage    | Example	       | Description
snake_case	     total_price	      Words lowercase, separated by underscores. Common in Python.
camelCase	       totalPrice	        First word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized. Common in JavaScript, sometimes VBA.
PascalCase	     TotalPrice	        Every word capitalized. Used for classes in many languages.
UPPER_CASE	      MAX_LIMIT	        Constants or macros.

Best practices:

Follow language or team standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python).

Be descriptive but concise.

Avoid ambiguous abbreviations.

Use consistent casing for similar entities.
