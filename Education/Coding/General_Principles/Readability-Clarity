What it means:
Write code that is easy to read and understand, not just for yourself but for others (including future you).

Clear code helps with debugging, maintenance, and collaboration.

How to achieve it:
Use meaningful variable and function names that describe their purpose.

Keep functions and methods small and focused—each should do one thing.

Write comments to explain why you’re doing something, not what the code does. The code itself should show what it does.

Use consistent indentation and spacing. Most languages have style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

Avoid complex or nested logic where simpler solutions exist.

Best practices:

Always name variables, functions, and classes to reflect their role.

Break code into logical chunks with whitespace and line breaks.

Use comments sparingly and meaningfully.

Format code according to your language’s style guide.
