What it means:
Break your program into separate, independent parts â€” functions, classes, modules.

Each module or function should handle a specific piece of functionality.

Why it matters:
Makes code easier to read, maintain, and test.

Allows reusing parts of the program in other projects.

Facilitates teamwork by enabling different people to work on different modules.

How to achieve it:
Write small, focused functions or methods.

Organize related functions/classes into modules or files.

Use classes to encapsulate data and behavior together.

Avoid large monolithic code blocks.

Best practices:

Aim for functions/classes that do one thing.

Organize code logically by functionality.

Use meaningful module and function names.

Keep interfaces (inputs/outputs) clear and minimal.
