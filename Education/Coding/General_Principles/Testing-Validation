What it means:
Ensuring your code works correctly through systematic checks.

Validation ensures inputs/data meet expected criteria before processing.

Why it matters:
Prevents bugs and unexpected behavior.

Increases code reliability and confidence.

Helps catch regressions early when modifying code.

How to do it:
Testing: write automated tests (unit tests) that verify functions behave as expected.

Validation: check user inputs or data formats before using them.

Best practices:

Write tests for critical functions and edge cases.

Validate all user inputs before processing.

Automate tests to run regularly.

Use clear, helpful error messages.
