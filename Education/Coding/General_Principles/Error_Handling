What it means:
Prepare your code to deal gracefully with unexpected situations or inputs, preventing crashes or incorrect behavior.

Why it matters:
Improves program robustness and user experience.

Makes debugging easier by providing clear error messages.

Helps avoid data corruption or loss.


Best practices:
Catch specific exceptions/errors rather than a generic catch-all.

Clean up resources (files, connections) in finally (Python) or after error handling in VBA.

Provide meaningful messages to help diagnose problems.

Log errors where appropriate.
